# Do you know [Eel Slap](http://eelslap.com)?

My friends and I spent the first Covid lockdown working for a local farm on their asparagus fields.
Even though harvesting asparagus is quite physically strenuous, our minds never got tired of coming up with stupid
things to do after work.

These also involved slapping my flatmate Benni in his face using gigantic rogue asparagus, growing right next to the
fields.

**Months after the harvesting season we discovered that the recording of this brilliant scene still exists.
We had to do something with it...**

Many thanks to our favourite farm - [Obst- und Weinhof Walter](https://ferienhof-walter.de/) - for putting our time in
the first lockdown to good use and making it surprisingly fun.
